#Super Smart Fan


"Bathroom Fan Control"

********************************************

This app was designed to control a bathroom extractor fan

If configured correctly it should:

1. Turn on the fan when it's too humid (turning off when humidity returns to a normal level)
2. Turn on with motion. - Turn off automatically after a pre set time period when motion stops (if humidity is normal)
3. Turn off automatically after a pre set time period when manually switched on (if humidity is normal)
