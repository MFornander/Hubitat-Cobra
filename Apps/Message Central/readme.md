# Message Central

__________________________________________________________________________


This is a port from SmartThings of my Message Central smartapp
Originally, most of the features were enabled to allow your home to 'speak' or send sms messages

Unfortunately, at the moment, Hubitat does not have this ability.
This means that TTS (textToSpeech) has been disabled for the time being (until Hubitat has that ability)

So, although you have almost all the same 'triggers' you can only configure either SMS or 'PushOver' messages for the output.

As soon as Hubitat has the ability to use TTS, I will reinstate the speach option.
