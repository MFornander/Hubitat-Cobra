#Irrigation Switch


"Turn on a switch when there is insufficient rain so that the garden requires watering"

This little app will allow you to set 'weighting' for previous and predicted rain along with a 'threshold'
You can also configure when to check the calculation and when to switch

Then it will decide whether to switch on or not
