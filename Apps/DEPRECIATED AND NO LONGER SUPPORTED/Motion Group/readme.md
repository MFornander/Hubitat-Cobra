This little app will 'aggregate' motion sensors.

This is used with the in-built 'Virtual Motion Sensor'

Input a number of physical motion sensors and if any of them are 'active' then the virtual device will be too
Once all physical sensors are 'inactive' (after a configurable timeout) the virtual sensor will show inactive too
