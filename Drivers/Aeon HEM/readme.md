Aeon Labs HEM V2 (Gen5) Driver
---------------------------------------

This driver can be used with the Aeon Labs HEM V2 (Gen5)
Most of the code was ported from ST


You have the ability to configure the reset of accumilated cost etc on a set date or every day/week etc

Cost can be in different currencies (although no conversion takes place)

Voltage is derived from the mains connection to the device NOT the clamp(s)

I have to credit @ogiewon for his excellent Pushover code which I have added here so that a summary is sent before reset.


To use: Install the device and assign this driver to it (If not correctly detected)
