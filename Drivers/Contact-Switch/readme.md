# Hubitat

Generic Z-Wave Contact/Switch Driver
---------------------------------------

This driver can be used with the Foxx Project?Aeon door/window contact along with others
The difference to the Hubitat driver is that it will also be recognised as a switch.
This means you can use modified contacts to 'switch' other devices/apps

You have the ability to have the switch ON when the contact is open or closed (configurable)
I have also added the ability to reverse open/closed operation independently from switch

You also now have the ability to 'force' either open or closed


To use: Install the device and assign this driver to it (If not correctly detected)
