Weather Drivers
---------------------------------------

There are two drivers in this folder:

	1. WeatherUndergroundCustom
	2. Weewx Weather Driver - With External Forecasting



  1. This driver uses a weather underground api to get local weather information into a useable foremat for Hubitat

  2. This driver uses 'Weewx' - This is a piece of software (usually run on a Raspberry Pi) that collects data from a PWS (Personal Weather Station)
      and presents the results in a Hubitat usable format



To use either driver: Install a virtual device and assign the driver to it
